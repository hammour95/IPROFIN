## **Description**:

IPROFIN is a powerful pipeline for for predicting conserved outer membrane protein (OMPs) targets from a set of input sequences.
The tool combines various tools and machine learning methods, including data preprocessing, clustering of homologous proteins, pre-filtering for performance improvement, localization prediction for identifying OMPs, and multiple sequence alignment to identify conserved regions.

The tool is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, with a streamlined pipeline that reduces processing time and increases accuracy. It also includes optional tools for extra analysis and visualization, making it a versatile tool for a range of use cases.

Whether you're a bioinformatics researcher, a scientist, or a student, IPROFIN is an essential tool for analyzing protein of different species and gaining insights into the presence of OMPs and conserved regions.

## **Dependencies and Building**:

- JDK 19+
- JavaFX 19
